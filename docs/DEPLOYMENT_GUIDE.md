# Deployment Guide

> Status: baseline written in Phase 1; completed and validated in Phase 10.

Serving the SPA and API from the **same origin** is required for Sanctum cookie authentication without third-party cookies.

## Environment (`backend/.env` in production)

```
APP_ENV=production
APP_DEBUG=false
APP_URL=https://pos.example.com
FRONTEND_URL=https://pos.example.com
SANCTUM_STATEFUL_DOMAINS=pos.example.com
SESSION_DOMAIN=pos.example.com
SESSION_SECURE_COOKIE=true
SESSION_ENCRYPT=true
DB_CONNECTION=pgsql
CACHE_STORE=redis
QUEUE_CONNECTION=redis
SESSION_DRIVER=redis
REDIS_CLIENT=predis
LOG_CHANNEL=daily
LOG_LEVEL=warning
```

Secrets (`APP_KEY`, `DB_PASSWORD`, `REDIS_PASSWORD`, AI provider keys) come from the host's secret store or environment, never from the repository.

Storefront hosts: every host listed under **Online store → Domains** must point at this server (and be covered by the TLS certificate); the backend resolves the organization from the `Host` header. Settings: `STOREFRONT_SHELL_PATH` (default `../frontend/dist/storefront.html`), `MEDIA_DISK` (`public`, or an S3-compatible disk whose URL is the CDN). Leave `STOREFRONT_DEFAULT_HOST` empty in production.

Newsletter confirmations and other storefront e-mails need a working mailer (`MAIL_*`) and a queue worker (the confirmation e-mail is queued). Links in these e-mails use the host the visitor signed up on. HTMLPurifier caches its compiled definitions in `storage/framework/cache/htmlpurifier` (created on first use; the storage directory must be writable).

Online catalog (E6):
- **The scheduler must run** (`php artisan schedule:run` every minute from cron, or `php artisan schedule:work` under a supervisor): it refreshes the storefront popularity figures hourly (`storefront:refresh-product-stats`, also runnable by hand, `--organization=<id>` for one tenant). Without it the *popularity* sort and *best sellers* sections use stale or no data.
- The E6 migration runs `CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pg_trgm` and builds a trigram index on product names. The migrating role needs the right to create the extension (on PostgreSQL 13+ `pg_trgm` is a trusted extension, so `CREATE` privilege on the database is enough; otherwise create it once as a superuser before `migrate`, after which the statement is a no-op).
- Run `php artisan pos:permissions:sync` after deploying (as in the release steps) so the built-in roles receive `online_catalog.view`, `online_catalog.manage` and `attributes.manage`.
- Choose a **fulfilment store** under *Online store → Settings & domains*; until then stock-tracked products show as out of stock on the storefront.

## Release steps

```bash
# backend
composer install --no-dev --optimize-autoloader
php artisan migrate --force
php artisan storage:link        # once: media and product images under /storage
php artisan pos:permissions:sync  # new module permissions -> built-in roles
php artisan optimize            # config, routes, events, views cache
php artisan queue:restart

# frontend
npm ci
npm run build                   # publish frontend/dist
```

## Processes

| Process | Command | Supervision |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| Queue workers | `php artisan queue:work redis --tries=3 --max-time=3600` | systemd/Supervisor, ≥2 workers |
| Scheduler | `php artisan schedule:run` every minute (cron) — prunes idempotency keys daily, refreshes storefront product stats hourly | cron |
| Health probe | `GET /api/v1/health` (200 / 503) and `GET /up` | load balancer |

## Database

- Application connects as a non-superuser role that owns the schema; a separate read-only role for reporting replicas (optional).
- Daily base backups + WAL archiving (point-in-time recovery). Restore drills each release cycle.
- Run migrations before switching traffic; migrations must be backward compatible with the previous release (expand → migrate → contract).

## Security checklist

- `APP_DEBUG=false`; Scramble docs disabled or gated (`viewApiDocs`).
- HTTPS only, HSTS, secure + HttpOnly + SameSite=Lax cookies.
- Upload storage outside the web root; images served through signed/authorized routes.
- Rate limiters enabled; fail2ban or WAF on login endpoints.
- Log shipping with `request_id` correlation; alerts on 5xx rate and queue backlog.
